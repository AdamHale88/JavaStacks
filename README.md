  - IoC container, Beans, Annotations

  - Spring Boot basics (auto-config, application.properties)

- Gradle:

  - Understanding tasks

  - Build lifecycle

  - Adding dependencies

**Mini Project:** Build a simple Spring Boot REST API with Gradle.

---

### Week 5: Spring MVC & Data JPA

- Spring:

  - Controllers & RestControllers

  - REST endpoints

  - Spring Data JPA with an H2 or MySQL database

- Testing:

  - Write unit tests for controllers and repositories

**Mini Project:** Extend your Spring app with CRUD endpoints and database storage.

---

### Week 6: Spring Security & CI/CD Intro

- Spring:

  - Authentication & Authorization basics

  - Securing endpoints

- Jenkins:

  - Install Jenkins locally

  - Create a basic job that builds your Gradle project

**Mini Project:** Secure one API endpoint with Spring Security and build it in Jenkins.

---

## **Phase 3: Frontend & DevOps (Weeks 7–9)**

Add **Angular frontend** and deepen DevOps with Jenkins & Ansible.

### Week 7: Angular Fundamentals

- Angular:

  - Modules, Components, Templates

  - Data binding & events

  - Services & Dependency Injection

**Mini Project:** Create a basic Angular app that displays a list of items.

---

### Week 8: Angular + Spring Integration

- Angular:

  - HttpClient to call REST APIs

  - Forms (Reactive vs Template-driven)

- Backend:

  - Connect Angular frontend to your Spring REST API

**Mini Project:** Build a small full-stack app (Angular frontend + Spring backend).

---

### Week 9: Jenkins Pipelines & Ansible

- Jenkins:

  - Declarative pipelines (Jenkinsfile)

  - Integrating GitHub triggers (webhooks)

- Ansible:

  - Inventories, playbooks, roles

  - Deploying your Spring Boot app with Ansible

**Mini Project:** Automate your app build/test pipeline in Jenkins & deploy with Ansible.

---

## **Phase 4: Enterprise Deployment (Weeks 10–12)**

Round it out with **WebLogic and Oracle ADF** for enterprise-grade deployments.

### Week 10: WebLogic Fundamentals

- WebLogic:

  - Domains, Admin & Managed Servers

  - Deploying WAR/EAR files

  - JDBC Data Sources

**Mini Project:** Package your Spring Boot app as a WAR and deploy it to WebLogic.

---

### Week 11: Oracle ADF Basics

- ADF Architecture (MVC)

- Business Components

- Task Flows

- ADF Faces UI

**Mini Project:** Build a simple ADF application and deploy it to WebLogic.

---

### Week 12: Integration & Wrap-Up

- Combine everything:

  - Backend: Spring Boot

  - Frontend: Angular

  - CI/CD: Jenkins + Ansible

  - Deployment: WebLogic / ADF

- Review & strengthen weak areas

**Capstone Project:** Full-stack enterprise-style app deployed via Jenkins pipeline onto WebLogic, with some configuration managed by Ansible.
